# Shin-Dialectics 2.0 — Priority Record (English)

## Abstract
Shin‑Dialectics 2.0 is a dialectical thinking framework for AI–human co‑thinking. It replaces the linear *thesis → antithesis → synthesis* pattern with **Simultaneous Multiple Negation (E₂(n))**—the concurrent generation of many antitheses and their multi‑dimensional integration. The system operationalizes **quantitative→structural→qualitative** transitions using explicit thresholds (**λₚ, λₐ, λₛ, λᵢ**) and a three‑layer prompting architecture that mutually constrains **divergence, convergence, and integration**. It also formalizes **internal vs. external negation** and the creative tension between them, introduces a **question dialectics** for meta‑problem framing, and models concepts via **quantum‑like superposition** and **thinking manifolds** with high‑curvature creative regions.

This repository fixes the state of the work as of the tag above. Public timestamp + file **SHA‑256 hashes** ensure verifiable priority. See `HASHES.txt` and `REPRODUCIBILITY.md`.

## Claims (C1–C8)
- C1: Simultaneous Multiple Negation **E₂(n)**
- C2: Phase thresholds **λₚ, λₐ, λₛ, λᵢ**
- C3: Internal/External negation and creative tension ★
- C4: Question dialectics and leap (⇗)
- C5: Quantum superposition \|ψ⟩
- C6: High‑curvature regions in a thinking manifold
- C7: Three‑Layer Integrative Prompting (SIP)
- C8: Thinking OS and λ‑monitor

## How to verify
1. Open `HASHES.txt` and copy the SHA‑256 of any file (e.g., `docs/doc6_*.md`).  
2. Open that file → **Raw** → download it.  
3. Locally compute SHA‑256 and confirm it **matches** the value in `HASHES.txt`.
