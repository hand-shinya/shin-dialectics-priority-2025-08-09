## 0) Abstract
Shin‑Dialectics 2.0 proposes a dialectical operating system for AI–human co‑thinking. It replaces linear *thesis → antithesis → synthesis* with **Simultaneous Multiple Negation (E₂(n))**—the parallel generation of many antitheses—and integrates them through a **three‑layer prompting architecture** that mutually constrains divergence, convergence, and integration. Quantitative accumulation drives **structural re‑organization** and culminates in **qualitative transition** at explicit thresholds (λₚ, λₐ, λₛ, λᵢ). The framework formalizes internal vs. external negation and their creative tension, introduces a dialectics of questions, and models concepts via quantum‑like superposition and a high‑curvature “thinking manifold.”

## 1) Core Claims (C1–C8)
- **C1 — E₂(n):** Simultaneous Multiple Negation enables non‑linear thought by generating 20+ antitheses in parallel and integrating them.
- **C2 — Thresholds:** Quantitative→structural→qualitative transitions are governed by λ thresholds: **λₚ** (questions), **λₐ** (antitheses), **λₛ** (syntheses), **λᵢ** (information items).
- **C3 — Internal/External Negation:** Internal critique n(T)[i]; external critique ¬T[e]; their tension (★) drives emergence.
- **C4 — Question Dialectics & Leap (⇗):** Multi‑layer interrogation of explicit/implicit premises and paradigm‑level reframing.
- **C5 — Quantum Superposition:** \|ψ⟩ = α\|thesis⟩ + Σβᵢ\|antithesisᵢ⟩ + Σγⱼ\|synthesisⱼ⟩.
- **C6 — Thinking Manifold:** High‑curvature creative regions mark breakdowns of prior frames and open new integrations.
- **C7 — Three‑Layer Integrative Prompting (SIP):** Operational design that couples divergence/convergence/integration.
- **C8 — Thinking OS:** Phase protocol + λ‑monitor + reproducibility/priority ledger.

## 2) Three‑Layer Integrative Prompting (SIP)
- **Layer A — Divergence:** Generate many distinct negations (20+) from heterogeneous lenses; keep orthogonality high.
- **Layer B — Convergence:** Cluster, weight, and compress; surface contradictions; select 12+ synthesis candidates.
- **Layer C — Integration:** Compose actionable syntheses; define evaluation hooks and log *why* items were kept/dropped.
- **Mutual constraints:** Each layer exposes targets/quotas for the next layer; quotas are λ‑aligned (e.g., λₐ≥20, λₛ≥12).

## 3) Phase Protocol (Thinking OS)
- **Phase 0 — Ontological triage:** Extract explicit/implicit premises; define metrics and stopping conditions.
- **Phase 1 — Quantitative build‑up:** Hit λ quotas (questions/negations/syntheses/information).
- **Phase 2 — Structural re‑organization:** Hierarchize, network, and compress with traceable justifications.
- **Phase 3 — Qualitative transition (◎):** Meta‑concepts emerge; execute the leap (⇗) when constraints are satisfied.
- **Phase 4 — Dialectical integration:** Publish synthesis set + evidence; capture decisions in a priority ledger.
- **Phase X — Reflexive evolution:** Improve prompts, quotas, and evaluation from logs and post‑mortems.

## 4) λ‑Monitor (Minimal)
Maintain a live counter for λₚ/λₐ/λₛ/λᵢ with target thresholds and % completion, and trigger a checkpoint when all exceed 80% (e.g., λₐ≥18/20).

## 5) Evidence & Reproducibility
- **Public timestamp:** GitHub commit + tagged Release `v2025.08.11`.
- **Hashes:** `HASHES.txt`; any file’s SHA‑256 must match local computation.
- **Ledger:** `PRIORITY-LEDGER.md` records release URL, verification logs, and tag‑protection status.

## 6) Evaluation & Use
- **Before/After studies:** Compare one‑shot vs. SIP on the same task; measure novelty, coherence, and actionability.
- **Domains:** Research design, strategy, policy analysis, and creative work where multi‑perspective synthesis matters.
