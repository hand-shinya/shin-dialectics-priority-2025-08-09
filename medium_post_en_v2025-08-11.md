Shin‑Dialectics 2.0: From Linear Dialectics to Simultaneous Multiple Negation
======================================================================

**TL;DR** — Linear *thesis → antithesis → synthesis* is too narrow for AI‑era thinking. Shin‑Dialectics 2.0 replaces it with **Simultaneous Multiple Negation (E₂(n))** and a **three‑layer prompting architecture** that couples divergence, convergence, and integration under explicit λ‑thresholds. A public **priority ledger** (tag v2025.08.11) fixes what existed when.

### Why this matters
Most “debates” explore one counter‑view at a time. We generate many—20+—in parallel, force them to collide, and then integrate the survivors. Quantity (λ) drives structure, which triggers qualitative leaps.

### The core moves
- **E₂(n):** many antitheses at once → creative tension ★  
- **λ‑thresholds:** λₚ (questions), λₐ (antitheses), λₛ (syntheses), λᵢ (info)  
- **SIP (three layers):** Diverge → Converge → Integrate, with mutual quotas  
- **Question dialectics:** interrogate explicit/implicit premises; execute the leap (⇗)  
- **Model:** quantum‑like superposition and high‑curvature thinking manifold

### How to verify priority
See the repository (tag **v2025.08.11**). Open `HASHES.txt`, download any file via **Raw**, compute SHA‑256 locally—it must match. The release is **publicly timestamped**.
